# HTClinicHub API Gateway - Postman Collection

## üìã Overview

This comprehensive Postman collection provides complete coverage of both the HTClinicHub API Gateway (port 3000) and the direct Auth Service (port 3001) endpoints. The collection is organized into logical folders with sample data and automated testing capabilities, with endpoints from both services categorized together for logical workflow organization.

## üèóÔ∏è Dual Service Architecture

HTClinicHub uses a microservice architecture with two main entry points:

### üö™ API Gateway (Port 3000)

- **Purpose**: Main entry point for most application requests
- **Path**: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- **Features**: Request routing, load balancing, authentication proxy
- **Use Case**: Frontend applications, mobile apps, external integrations

### üîê Auth Service (Port 3001)

- **Purpose**: Direct authentication and authorization service
- **Path**: `http://localhost:3001`
- **Features**: User management, roles, permissions, invitations, JWT handling
- **Use Case**: Direct service-to-service communication, administrative tasks

### üìã Why Both Services?

Each endpoint category includes both Gateway and Direct Auth Service requests to support:

- **Development Testing**: Compare Gateway vs Direct responses
- **Service Debugging**: Isolate issues to specific services
- **Administrative Tasks**: Direct access to auth features
- **Performance Testing**: Compare routing overhead

## üîë Authentication Flow

### For Staff/Admin Testing:

1. **Login**: Use "Clinic User Login" or "Admin Login"
2. **Automatic Token Storage**: Tokens are automatically stored in environment variables
3. **Authorization**: Most requests use `{{staff_token}}` automatically

### For Patient Testing:

## üß™ Testing Features

### Automated Token Storage

Login requests automatically store tokens in environment variables:

```javascript
if (pm.response.code === 200) {
  const response = pm.response.json();
  if (response.token) {
    pm.environment.set('staff_token', response.token);
  }
}
```

### ID Extraction

Create requests automatically store generated IDs:

```javascript
if (pm.response.code === 201) {
  const response = pm.response.json();
  if (response.id) {
    pm.environment.set('created_doctor_id', response.id);
  }
}
```

### Error Logging

Global error handling logs response details for debugging.

## üìã Testing Workflows

- Select files using the file picker
- Multiple file uploads supported

### Query Parameters

Many endpoints support filtering and pagination:

```
?page=1&limit=10&search=John&searchBy=name&type=doctor
```

### Error Handling

All requests include error response logging for debugging.

## üåç Environment Switching

You can easily switch between environments by changing the `environment` variable:

- `local`: Uses localhost:3000 (Gateway) and localhost:3001 (Auth Service)
- `staging`: Uses staging URLs for both services
- `production`: Uses production URLs for both services

The collection automatically updates both `base_url` and `auth_service_url` based on the environment setting.

## üìû Support

For issues with the API collection:

1. Check environment variable values
2. Verify authentication tokens are valid
3. Review request body format against examples
4. Check server logs for detailed error information

## üîí Security Notes

- Tokens are marked as "secret" type in environment
- Never commit real authentication tokens to version control
- Use different tokens for different environments
- Regularly rotate authentication credentials
